## Template Variables Used

Make sure your EmailJS template includes these variables:
- `{{to_name}}` - Recipient's name
- `{{to_email}}` - Recipient's email
- `{{from_name}}` - Person sharing the board
- `{{from_email}}` - Sharer's email
- `{{board_title}}` - Name of the shared board
- `{{board_url}}` - Direct link to the board
- `{{permission_level}}` - User's permission (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
- `{{permission_description}}` - What they can do
- `{{app_name}}` - "TrelloX"
- `{{message}}` - Personalized message

## Test Your Configuration

1. **Restart your development server** to load the new environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test email notifications**:
   - Open TrelloX in your browser
   - Share a board with someone
   - Check if they receive an email

3. **Check browser console** for any error messages

## Troubleshooting

### If emails aren't sending:
1. **Check EmailJS Dashboard**: Verify your service is connected and active
2. **Verify Template**: Make sure template `template_69mkl1h` exists and is published
3. **Check Console**: Look for error messages in browser developer tools
4. **Test Service**: Try sending a test email from EmailJS dashboard

### Common Issues:
- **Service not connected**: Make sure your email service (Gmail, etc.) is properly connected in EmailJS
- **Template not found**: Verify the template ID is correct
- **Quota exceeded**: Free EmailJS accounts have 200 emails/month limit
- **Blocked by email provider**: Some providers block automated emails
