# Sticky Notes Creator Attribution Feature

## Overview
This feature adds visual indicators to sticky notes that show which board member created each note when a board has multiple collaborators. The indicators are only visible on boards with multiple members to avoid clutter on single-user boards.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Visual Creator Indicators**
- **Avatar Display**: Shows user's profile picture if available
- **Initials Fallback**: Shows user initials when no profile picture is available
- **Positioning**: Located in bottom-right corner of each sticky note
- **Styling**: Circular indicator with subtle shadow and border

### 2. **Smart Visibility**
- **Multi-Member Boards**: Indicators only appear when board has 2+ members
- **Single-Member Boards**: No indicators shown to avoid visual clutter
- **Dynamic Updates**: Indicators appear/disappear as members are added/removed

### 3. **Interactive Tooltips**
- **Hover Activation**: Tooltip appears when hovering over the indicator
- **Creator Information**: Shows "Created by [Name/Email]"
- **Positioning**: Appears above the indicator with arrow pointer
- **Styling**: Dark background with white text for good contrast

### 4. **Theme Support**
- **Light Theme**: White borders and light shadows
- **Dark Theme**: Dark borders and adjusted shadows
- **Responsive**: Adapts to system color scheme preferences

### 5. **Drag Functionality Preservation**
- **Non-Interfering**: Indicators don't interfere with drag operations
- **Proper Z-Index**: Positioned above note content but below drag layer
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle scale animation on hover

### 6. **Backwards Compatibility**
- **Legacy Board Support**: Automatically handles boards created before this update
- **Missing BoardMembers**: Builds member data from existing `members` array
- **Legacy Sticky Notes**: Gracefully handles notes without `createdBy` field
- **Automatic Migration**: Migrates data in Firestore for future use
- **Fallback Indicators**: Shows special icon (üìù) for legacy notes

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Have TrelloX running locally
2. Be signed in with a user account
3. Have at least one board created

### Test Scenario 1: Single Member Board
1. Create a new board or use existing single-member board
2. Right-click on board background and select "Add Sticky Note"
3. **Expected**: No creator indicator should appear on the sticky note
4. **Reason**: Single-member boards don't show indicators to avoid clutter

### Test Scenario 2: Multi-Member Board Setup
1. Open Board Sharing modal (Share button in header)
2. Add another user to the board by email
3. Create sticky notes from different user accounts
4. **Expected**: Creator indicators should appear on all sticky notes

### Test Scenario 3: Avatar Display
1. Ensure your user account has a profile picture (Google sign-in usually provides this)
2. Create a sticky note on a multi-member board
3. **Expected**: Your profile picture should appear as a small circular avatar

### Test Scenario 4: Initials Fallback
1. Use an account without a profile picture
2. Create a sticky note on a multi-member board
3. **Expected**: Circular indicator with your initials should appear

### Test Scenario 5: Tooltip Functionality
1. On a multi-member board with sticky notes
2. Hover over a creator indicator
3. **Expected**: Tooltip showing "Created by [Name]" should appear above the indicator

### Test Scenario 6: Dynamic Visibility
1. Start with a single-member board (no indicators visible)
2. Add a second member via Board Sharing
3. **Expected**: Creator indicators should immediately appear on existing sticky notes
4. Remove the second member
5. **Expected**: Creator indicators should disappear

### Test Scenario 7: Drag Functionality
1. On a multi-member board with sticky notes showing creator indicators
2. Drag sticky notes around the board
3. **Expected**: Drag functionality should work normally, indicators should not interfere

### Test Scenario 8: Backwards Compatibility
1. Test with boards created before this update (if available)
2. Check boards that have multiple members but no `boardMembers` array
3. Check sticky notes that don't have `createdBy` field
4. **Expected**:
   - Indicators should appear automatically after loading
   - Legacy notes should show üìù icon with "Legacy Note" tooltip
   - Migration should happen automatically in background
   - Console should show migration messages

## Browser Console Testing
Open browser developer tools and check console for debug messages:
- Look for "StickyNote Creator Attribution Debug" messages
- Verify board member data is being passed correctly
- Check that `shouldShow` logic is working as expected
