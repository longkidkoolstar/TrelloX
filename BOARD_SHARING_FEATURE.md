# Board Sharing & Collaboration Feature

## Overview
The Board Sharing & Collaboration feature allows users to share their TrelloX boards with other users and collaborate in real-time. This feature includes user search, permission management, and member administration.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Board Sharing Modal**
- **Location**: `src/components/BoardSharingModal.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Provides a comprehensive interface for managing board members
- **Features**:
  - Search users by email address
  - Add members with different permission levels
  - View current board members
  - Remove members from boards
  - Update member permissions
  - Real-time member list updates

### 2. **Permission System**
- **Owner**: Full access, can manage all members and permissions
- **Admin**: Can edit board content and manage members (future enhancement)
- **Member**: Can view and edit board content
- **Viewer**: Can only view board content (read-only access)

### 3. **User Management Functions**
- **Location**: `src/firebase/firestore.ts`
- **Functions Added**:
  - `searchUsersByEmail()`: Search for users by email address
  - `getUserProfile()`: Get individual user profile
  - `getUserProfiles()`: Get multiple user profiles efficiently
  - `addMemberToBoard()`: Add a user to a board with specified permissions
  - `removeMemberFromBoard()`: Remove a user from a board
  - `updateMemberPermission()`: Change a member's permission level
  - `getBoardMembers()`: Get detailed member information for a board
  - `checkBoardPermission()`: Verify user permissions for specific actions

### 4. **Enhanced Data Models**
- **Location**: `src/types.ts`
- **New Types**:
  - `BoardPermission`: Permission levels (owner, admin, member, viewer)
  - `BoardMember`: Detailed member information with permissions
  - `BoardInvitation`: Future invitation system support

### 5. **UI Integration**
- **Share Button**: Added to the header next to board selector
- **Responsive Design**: Modal works on both desktop and mobile
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately in the UI
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and success notifications

## How to Use

### Sharing a Board
1. Open a board you own
2. Click the "Share" button in the header
3. Enter the email address of the user you want to invite
4. Select their permission level (Viewer, Member, or Admin)
5. The user will be added to the board immediately

### Managing Members
1. Open the sharing modal for any board you own
2. View all current members and their permissions
3. Change permissions using the dropdown menus
4. Remove members using the "Remove" button
5. Changes take effect immediately

### Permission Levels
- **Owner**: You (board creator) - cannot be changed or removed
- **Admin**: Can manage members and edit content (future feature)
- **Member**: Can edit board content (lists, cards, etc.)
- **Viewer**: Can only view the board content

## Security & Privacy

### Firestore Rules
- Users can only search for and view basic profile information of other users
- Board access is strictly controlled by the `members` array
- Only board owners can add/remove members and change permissions
- Users can only access boards they are explicitly members of

### Data Protection
- Email addresses are used for user search and identification
- User profile information (name, photo) is shared for collaboration purposes
- No sensitive user data is exposed through the sharing system

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
```
boards/{boardId}
├── members: [userId1, userId2, ...] // For backward compatibility
├── boardMembers: [
│   {
│     userId: string,
│     email: string,
│     displayName: string,
│     photoURL: string,
│     permission: BoardPermission,
│     joinedAt: string
│   }
│ ]
└── ... other board data

users/{userId}
├── uid: string
├── email: string
├── displayName: string
├── photoURL: string
└── createdAt: string
```

### Key Components
1. **BoardSharingModal**: Main UI component for member management
2. **Header**: Contains the Share button
3. **App**: Manages modal state and board updates
4. **Firestore Functions**: Handle all backend operations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Email Invitations**: Send email invites to users not yet on the platform
2. **Board Templates**: Share board templates with specific permission sets
3. **Activity Log**: Track member actions and changes
4. **Bulk Member Management**: Add/remove multiple members at once
5. **Team Workspaces**: Organize boards into team-based workspaces
6. **Advanced Permissions**: More granular permission controls

### Invitation System (Prepared)
- Database structure ready for invitation system
- Firestore rules configured for invitation management
- Types defined for future implementation

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create a new board
2. Click the Share button
3. Search for another user by email
4. Add them as a member
5. Verify they can access the board
6. Test permission changes
7. Test member removal
8. Verify security (non-members cannot access)

### Error Scenarios
- Adding non-existent users
- Adding users already on the board
- Removing the board owner
- Unauthorized permission changes

## Deployment Notes

### Production Considerations
1. Update Firestore rules to use production settings
2. Consider rate limiting for user search
3. Monitor database usage for large teams
4. Implement caching for frequently accessed user profiles

### Performance Optimizations
- User search results are cached during the session
- Batch user profile requests for efficiency
- Minimal data transfer for member updates
- Optimistic UI updates for better user experience
