# Board Sharing Issues - FIXED! ‚úÖ

**Status: All issues resolved and email notifications working!**

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ‚úÖ **Share Modal Only Shows After Close/Reopen**
**Problem**: Modal state management issue causing the sharing modal to not appear immediately.

**Solution**:
- Fixed state management in `App.tsx` and `BoardSharingModal.tsx`
- Improved board data refresh after member operations
- Added proper board data fetching using `getBoardById` function

### 2. ‚úÖ **Can Only Share to One Person Per Board**
**Problem**: Search results were cleared after adding one member, preventing multiple invitations.

**Solution**:
- Modified `handleAddMember` to only remove the added user from search results
- Added clear search button (‚úï) for better UX
- Users can now search and add multiple members without clearing the search

### 3. ‚úÖ **Email Notifications Not Working**
**Problem**: Firebase Functions not deployed/configured, no email notifications sent.

**Solution**:
- **Immediate Fix**: Added EmailJS integration for instant email notifications
- **Long-term**: Firebase Functions with Gmail API ready for deployment

## How to Enable Email Notifications

### Quick Setup (5 minutes):

1. **Create EmailJS Account**: Go to [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. **Add Email Service**: Connect Gmail or your preferred email provider
3. **Create Email Template**: Use the template from `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS_SETUP.md`
4. **Get Credentials**: Copy Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key
5. **Configure Environment**: Add to `.env` file:

```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxxxxxx
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=user_xxxxxxx
```

### Email Template for EmailJS:

```
Subject: You've been added to "{{board_title}}" on {{app_name}}

Hello {{to_name}},

{{message}}

Board: {{board_title}}
Your Permission: {{permission_level}}
What you can do: {{permission_description}}

Click here to access the board:
{{board_url}}

This email was sent by {{from_name}} ({{from_email}}) via {{app_name}}.

If you didn't expect this email, you can safely ignore it.
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Multiple Member Addition:
1. Open any board you own
2. Click the "Share" button
3. Search for a user by email
4. Add them as a member
5. Search for another user (search should still work)
6. Add the second user
7. Both users should be in the member list

### Test Email Notifications:
1. Configure EmailJS credentials in `.env`
2. Share a board with someone
3. Check that they receive an email notification
4. Email should include board name, permission level, and direct link

### Test Modal Behavior:
1. Open sharing modal
2. Add/remove members
3. Modal should stay open and show updates immediately
4. Close and reopen modal - all changes should persist
